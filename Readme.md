This is a little toy to try and train myself to recognize frequencies by ear. I got the idea while riding a plane and listening to the hum of the propeller outside my window. It works by randomizing the tone and wave form after every correct guess. 

# Wishlist
    - slider to control range of frequencies
    - slider to choose precision level
    - fancier status box (add color coding or symbols)
    - extra-tone option (repeated drum hits rather than a single tone)
    - make it so hitting enter submits a guess
# ultra wishlist
    - add a database connection to see trends
    - add some a/b testing to improve learning method
    - add a little animation when sound is playing
    - add an info panel explaining the game
    - add a persistence of vision/strobe effect mode
